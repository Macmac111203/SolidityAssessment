# Solidity Project Assessment

## Description

This program is a simple contract written in Solidity, a programming language used for developing smart contracts on the Ethereum blockchain. This program serves as a simple and straightforward introduction to Solidity programming, and can be used as a stepping stone for more complex projects in the future.

## Getting Started
To run this program, you can use Remix, an online Solidity IDE. To get started, go to the Remix website at https://remix.ethereum.org/.

Once you are on the Remix website, create a new file by clicking on the "+" icon in the left-hand sidebar. Save the file with a .sol extension (e.g., HelloWorld.sol). Copy and paste the following code into the file:

### Installing

https://remix.ethereum.org/

### Executing program

The Token Abbrv, Name, and totalSupply are the public variables.
The mapping are the public balances.
The mint function is where the address of the balance and totalsupplies

First is you need to go to the Solidity Compiler.
Next is you need to Compile the work HelloWorld.sol and also check the box that says auto compile. 
After that is go to deploy and run Transactions and next is deploy it.
And after that check the deployed Contracts and also check all the Token like the Abbrv, Name and the supply.
Then copy the account and paste it in the mint address and then put a value of your choice and then transact it.
And thats it, also check again the tokens so that you'll know how much is in it.
